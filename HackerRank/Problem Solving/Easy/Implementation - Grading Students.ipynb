    "HackerLand University has the following grading policy:  \n",
    "* Every student receives a $grade$ in the inclusive range from $0$ to $100$.  \n",
    "* Any $grade$ less than $40$ is a failing grade.  \n",

    "Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's $grade$ according to these rules:  \n",
    "* If the difference between the $grade$ and the next multiple of $5$ is less than $3$, round $grade$ up to the next multiple of $5$.  \n",
    "* If the value of $grade$ is less than $38$, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $grade=84$ will be rounded to $85$ but $grade=29$ will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than $40$.  \n",
