    "From $1700$ to $1917$, Russia's official calendar was the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar\">Julian calendar</a>; since $1919$ they used the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar\">Gregorian calendar</a> system. The transition from the Julian to Gregorian calendar system occurred in $1918$, when the next day after January $31^{st}$ was February $14^{th}$. This means that in $1918$, February $14^{th}$ was the $32^{nd}$ day of the year in Russia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both calendar systems, February is the only month with a variable amount of days; it has $29$ days during a leap year, and $28$ days during all other years. In the Julian calendar, leap years are divisible by $4$; in the Gregorian calendar, leap years are either of the following:  \n",

    "Given a year, $y$, find the date of the $256^{th}$ day of that year according to the official Russian calendar during that year. Then print it in the format dd.mm.yyyy, where dd is the two-digit day, mm is the two-digit month, and yyyy is $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the given $year=1984$. $1984$ is divisible by $4$, so it is a leap year. The $256^{th}$ day of a leap year after $1918$ is September 12, so the answer is $12.09.1984$.\n",
